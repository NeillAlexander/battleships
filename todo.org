* TODO Make the match playing asynchronous
* TODO Provide a way to update a player
When you submit, if the player name already exists, then reject it
unless the same namespace is provided, in which case update it. That
way teams can update their own player, all names are guaranteed to be
unique.
* TODO Display the leaderboard on the front page of the server
Sort by the most wins
* TODO Error handling still not good enough when players return bad data
Write a chaos monkey player
* TODO Persist the players somewhere
* TODO Provide a way to browse the source for a player
* TODO find a way to lock down the code that is eval'd
Clojail? Or write my own custom thing?
** TODO provide a way to have a tournament
** TODO in tournament mode, provide a way to watch players go against each other
* TODO lein marg the code and look for improvements in:
** TODO comments
** TODO common functions that can be factored out / improved
* TODO Write up a README for use at a dojo
Maybe just put that into the demo.clj

* Optional
** TODO do some analysis to work out the stats for average number of shots to win etc
** TODO Need to provide built in game stat support rather than relying on player implementation
*** TODO plot a graph using incanter to show this - acts as benchmark for improving
** TODO write a web front end for viewing the server stats
** TODO in server keep track of the best results
*** TODO win / loss ratio
*** TODO number of shots
*** TODO avg / mean / median / standard deviation etc
This will provide a way to rank players.
