* TODO write a support namespace which provides functions for submitting to the server
** DONE should have a verify function
To ensure that the implementation works before sending.
** DONE Solve the problem of providing a map implementation of the player
i.e. need to be able to read it in with the reader, so can't use
records etc
** TODO should have a submit function
* TODO Make sure the game engine is resilient to dodgy input!
* TODO write the server which will allow people to submit a player for evaluation
* TODO Server should play all players against each other
Keep a matrix with number of times each has played against each other.
* TODO Provide a way to update a player
Don't want to have people overriding someone elses! When submit,
provide an id?
* TODO in server keep track of the best results
** TODO win / loss ratio
** TODO number of shots
*** TODO avg / mean / median / standard deviation etc
This will provide a way to rank players.
* TODO do some analysis to work out the stats for average number of shots to win etc
** TODO Need to provide built in game stat support rather than relying on player implementation
** TODO plot a graph using incanter to show this - acts as benchmark for improving
* TODO write a web front end for viewing the server stats
* TODO provide a way to have a tournament
* TODO in tournament mode, provide a way to watch players go against each other
* TODO Write up a README for use at a dojo
Maybe just put that into the demo.clj
