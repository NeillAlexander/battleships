* TODO Server should play all players against each other
** DONE Keep a matrix with number of times each has played against each other.
** TODO Update the player scores and match tally at end of each match
And how come the cpu always wins? Something not right there...
** TODO Loop round playing matches until the limit is hit
** TODO Make the match playing asynchronous
* TODO Display the leaderboard on the front page of the server
Sort by the most wins
* TODO Error handling still not good enough when players return bad data
* TODO Persist the players somewhere
* TODO Provide a way to update a player
Don't want to have people overriding someone elses! When submit,
provide an id? Use the namespace that was returned on creation.
* TODO in server keep track of the best results
** TODO win / loss ratio
** TODO number of shots
*** TODO avg / mean / median / standard deviation etc
This will provide a way to rank players.
* TODO Provide a way to browse the source for a player
* TODO do some analysis to work out the stats for average number of shots to win etc
** TODO Need to provide built in game stat support rather than relying on player implementation
** TODO plot a graph using incanter to show this - acts as benchmark for improving
* TODO write a web front end for viewing the server stats
* TODO find a way to lock down the code that is eval'd
Clojail? Or write my own custom thing?
* TODO provide a way to have a tournament
* TODO in tournament mode, provide a way to watch players go against each other
* TODO Write up a README for use at a dojo
Maybe just put that into the demo.clj
